# Proj0810: Remove unused package versions
When using [Central Package Management](Proj0800.md) the central
`Directory.Packages.props` contains `<PackageVersion>`'s for all
`<PackageRefence>`'s in the solution. To reduce noise, thie rule reports on
`<PackageVersion`'s that are (not longer) referenced. This rule requires a
[`.net.csproj` SDK project](../general/sdk.md) to work.
