# Proj0501: Only include packages with a compliant license
Using a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) (third-party) package implies that you
and/or your company explicitly agree with the legally binding conditions of the
license and the copyright of the onwer of the package.

By default, MIT and Apache-2.0 are allowed.

## Configure
You can specify which license (expressions) are allowed, using `<AllowedLicenses>`.

``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <AllowedLicenses>MIT,MPL-1.1,Apache-2.0</AllowedLicenses>
  </PropertyGroup>
  
</Project>
```

For packages that do not come with a generic license (expression) such as MIT,
it is possible to specify that these packages are allowed, using the 
`<AllowedThirdPartyPackages>`. Wildcard characters are allowed.

``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
	<AllowedThirdPartyPackages>
		SonarAnalyzer.Csharp,
		MyCompany.*
	/AllowedThirdPartyPackages>
  </PropertyGroup>
  
</Project>
```
