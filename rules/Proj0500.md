# Proj0500: Only include packages with an explicitly defined license
Using a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) (third-party) package implies that you
and/or your company explicitly agree with the legally binding conditions of the
license and the copyright of the onwer of the package.

As Microsoft states it itself:
> If a package does not specify the licensing terms, contact the package owner
> directly using the Contact owners link on the [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org)
> package page. Microsoft does not license any intellectual property to you
> from third party package providers and is not responsible for information
> provided by third parties.

When you use packages that are only (privatly) shared without your company
those packages should also come with an explicitly defined license. You might
need to contact your legal department to define a proper license.
