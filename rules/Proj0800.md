# Proj0800: Configure Central Package Version Management explicitly
Dependency management is a core feature of NuGet. Managing dependencies for a
single project can be easy. Managing dependencies for multi-project solutions
can prove to be difficult as they start to scale in size and complexity. In
situations where you manage common dependencies for many different projects,
you can leverage Central Package Version Management (CPVM) features to do all of
this from the ease of a single location.

Hence, this rules advises to enable Central Package Version Management by
enabling it with `<ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>`.

## Non-compliant
``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
 
 <PropertyGroup>
   <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
 
</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

 <PropertyGroup>
   <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
   <ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>
 </PropertyGroup>
 
</Project>
```

When a solution has only a tiny number of project files, and/or hardly any
package is shared amongst these projects, CPVM might be not worth the
effort. In that case it is also fine to explicitly disable it.

``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

 <PropertyGroup>
   <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
   <ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>false</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>
 </PropertyGroup>
 
</Project>
```
