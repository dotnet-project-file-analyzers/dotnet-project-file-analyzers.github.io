# Proj0031: Correct the spelling of the node name
Spelling mistakes can lead to hard to solve bugs, as both properties as items
are free format fields according to MS Build. By having a big set of known
nodes to compare to, those kind of errors can be prevented.

## False positives
We tried our best to include the most common properties and items that can be
defined in an MS Build project file. However if this rule reports a false
positive, two actions can be taken:

### Report the FP to .NET Project Files Analyzers
This can be done by [Creating an Issue](https://github.com/dotnet-project-file-analyzers/dotnet-project-file-analyzers/issues/new)
on GitHub.

### Add to known node names
Known nodes can be added in the `.editorconfig` or `.globalconfig`. This is the
preferred way for uncommon custom nodes that could lead to false negatives for
most users of the analyzer.

``` INI
dotnet_diagnostic.Proj0031.KnownNodes = MyCustomNode;MyOtherNode
```
